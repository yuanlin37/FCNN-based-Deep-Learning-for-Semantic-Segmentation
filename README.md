# Self-Driving Car Lane Detection

## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to investigate a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), named Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN), and we are going to apply this technique to the lane detection of self-driving car.

## Tutorials
* More information about FCNN can be found in this paper.

## Dependencies
* Python 3
* Tensorflow

## Notes
* The following figure is generated by the tensorboard of the tensorflow, and shows the structure of this neural network.
